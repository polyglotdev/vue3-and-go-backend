    "\n",
    "1. Pointer vs. Value Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pointer (`*[]Player`)\n",
    "  - A pointer to a slice of Player structs means that the NBA struct holds a reference to the slice. Changes to the slice will be reflected in the NBA struct.\n",
    "- Value (`[Player]`) \n",
    "  - A value type means that the NBA struct holds its own copy of the slice. Changes to the slice elsewhere do not affect the 'NBA struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "   1. When using a pointer, you need to ensure that the slice is properly initialized before use. If not, you might encounter nil pointer dereference errors.\n",
    "   2. Using a value type simplifies initialization and avoids potential nil' pointer issues.\n",
